# finn_tripduration
Mission:
To find out walk/drive trip duration between apartments from finn.no and your custom address. Allows to focus on advertisements in appropriate range from your office or your childern's school.
Usage:
Basically finn.no have very good filtration options, and there is no point to code same functionality here.
Just browse to finn.no and select location (like Frogner), price and other conditions to search.
Copy this URL in script for ~UrlFinn variable.
Enter address of your office to ~WorkAdress variable.
Voila: just run script and get estimated trip duration from your office to your potential apartments.
Tip: change between walking, driving, bicycling, and transit (for public transport transit) parameters to fit results with your preferred trip style.
